defmodule PhoenixKitAI.Web.PlaygroundVoiceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Streaming voice (xAI realtime) panel in `PhoenixKitAI.Web.Playground`.

  `Xai.RealtimeBehaviour.connect_tts/1` is invoked from inside
  `PhoenixKitAI.Realtime.Session.init/1`, which runs in a process spawned
  by the LiveView process — not this test process — so Mox's global mode
  is used (see `PhoenixKitAI.Realtime.SessionTest` for the same rationale),
  hence no `async: true`.
